 josephus(n, k) = (josephus(n - 1, k) + k-1) % n + 1
  josephus(1, k) = 1
   
   After the first person (kth from beginning) is killed, n-1 persons are left. So we call josephus(n – 1, k)
   to get the position with n-1 persons. But the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k) will consider the position 
   starting from k%n + 1. So, we must make adjustments to the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k). 


   
   int josephus(int n, int k)
{
    if (n == 1)
        return 1;
    else
        /* The position returned by josephus(n - 1, k)
        is adjusted because the recursive call
        josephus(n - 1, k) considers the
        original position k % n + 1 as position 1 */
        return (josephus(n - 1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1;
}
